# Project 1

Program will create a "triangle.ppm" file, 800 pixels square with an image of a triangle with vertices generated randomly in the unit square ([0,1]x[0,1]) along with the triangle’s circumcircle, incircle, Euler line and the 9 point circle.

Also draw the 9 point circle for the triangle. Make sure the Euler line is a line across the entire screen not just a segment!!

Lines/Segments should be drawn with Bresenham’s algorithm, and circles should be drawn with a provided rasterized algorithm that uses only integer arithmetic.
