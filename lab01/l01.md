# Project 1

Program will create a "triangle.ppm" file, 800 pixels square with an image of a triangle with vertices generated randomly in the unit square ([0,1]x[0,1]) along with the triangle’s circumcircle, incircle, Euler line and the 9 point circle.

Also draw the 9 point circle for the triangle. Make sure the Euler line is a line across the entire screen not just a segment!!

Lines/Segments should be drawn with Bresenham’s algorithm, and circles should be drawn with a provided rasterized algorithm that uses only integer arithmetic.

1) The vertices are generated randomly in the unit square ([0,1]x[0,1]), all calculations to find incircle, circumcircle,... will be done in double in the unit square (it may go out of the screen). Once all calculations are done then the rendering is done by scalling the image to 800x800.
2) Lines should be drawn with Bresenham’s algorithm, and circles should be drawn with a provided rasterized algorithm that uses only integer arithmetic.
3) Make sure the Euler line is a line across the entire screen not just a segment!!
