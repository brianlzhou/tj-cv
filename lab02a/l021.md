# Project 2 (Smallest Square) Part 1

Part 1:

Create a method called part1 in which:
- 1) Generate 3 random points (optional: check that they are not collinear), and display the 3 points on the screen and in the file log.txt in a friendly format.
- 2) Then generate a 4th random point such that no point among the 4 points lies inside the triangle formed by the other 3 points in the square unit ([0,1]x[0,1]). If the last point
generated fails the condition, you discard it then you keep generating a new random 4th point until the condition is true. Every 4th point you generated should be displayed on the screen and also saved in log.txt by using a line stating " testing point (... , .....) " Once you have 4 such points save the 4 points in a file called points.txt following the exact format of the file:points.txt (notice the precision, maybe look up how to use setprecision when you cout, or how to use fprintf)
- 3) your main method should have only a call of the method part1(), nothing else!
When you finish submit the file l021.cpp file (lowercase L followed by th digits 021) and also complete and submit the following document, with the examples of points.txt obtained in 2 random runs: Project 2 Part 1 document.docx
